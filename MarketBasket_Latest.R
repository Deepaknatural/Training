# Attribute Information
# InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation. +StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
# Description: Product (item) name. Nominal.
# Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.
# InvoiceDate: Invoice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated. Example from dataset: 12/1/2010 8:26
# UnitPrice: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.
# CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.

# We need to do is group data in the retail dataframe either by CustomerID, CustomerID, and Date 
# we can also group data using InvoiceNo and Date.

# This can be done by ddply

# Total number of rules: The set of 49122 rules
# 
# Distribution of rule length: A length of 5 items has the most rules: 16424 and length of 2 items have the lowest number of rules:105

# Using the above output, you can make analysis such as:
#   
# 100% of the customers who bought 'WOBBLY CHICKEN' also bought 'METAL'.

# Removing redundant rules
# You can remove rules that are subsets of larger rules. Use the code below to remove such rules:

subset.rules <- which(colSums(is.subset(association.rules, association.rules)) > 1) # get subset rules in vector

length(subset.rules)

subset.association.rules. <- association.rules[-subset.rules] # remove subset rules.


# which() returns the position of elements in the vector for which value is TRUE.
# 
# colSums() forms a row and column sums for dataframes and numeric arrays.
# 
# is.subset() Determines if elements of one vector contain all the elements of other

# Finding Rules related to given items
# Sometimes, you want to work on a specific product. 
# If you want to find out what causes influence on the purchase of item X you can use appearance option 
# in the apriori command. appearance gives us options to set LHS (IF part) and RHS (THEN part) of the rule.


metal.association.rules <- apriori(tr, parameter = list(supp=0.001, conf=0.8),appearance = list(default="lhs",rhs="METAL"))

inspect(head(metal.association.rules))

# Similarly, to find the answer to the question Customers who bought METAL also bought
# .... you will keep METAL on lhs:


metal.association.rules <- apriori(tr, parameter = list(supp=0.001, conf=0.8),appearance = list(lhs="METAL",default="rhs"))

#Plot SubRules
plot(subRules)

#The above plot shows that rules with high lift have low support.



#plot(rulesObject, measure, shading, method)

# rulesObject: the rules object to be plotted
# 
# measure: Measures for rule interestingness. Can be Support, Confidence, lift or combination of these depending upon method value.
# 
# shading: Measure used to color points (Support, Confidence, lift). The default is Lift.
# 
# method: Visualization method to be used (scatterplot, two-key plot, matrix3D).


plot(subRules,method="two-key plot")

# The two-key plot uses support and confidence on x and y-axis respectively. 
# It uses order for coloring. The order is the number of items in the rule.


#Individual Rule Representation
# This representation is also called as Parallel Coordinates Plot. 
# It is useful to visualized which products along with which items cause what kind of sales.

# the RHS is the Consequent or the item we propose the customer will buy;
# the positions are in the LHS where 2 is the most recent addition to our basket 
# and 1 is the item we previously had.
